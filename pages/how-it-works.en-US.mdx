# How it works

This section will work you through a brief overview of what web3 infras we are using and how they work together.

## OS Composition

DataverseOS is similar to modern operating systems such as Linux, consisting of four important components

- `kernel`, manages the underlying resources and ensure system stability&security
- `system calls`, provides a set of APIs for applications to interact with the kernel
- `protocol drivers`, an open architecture for 3rd-party protocol integration
- `user interface`, UI for users to interact with the system, manage their data, and use applications

## Plug into Dataverse

DataverseOS integrates and coordinates many protocols such as [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/),
[Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/), [Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/), [filecoin](https://fvm.filecoin.io/) etc.

The encrypted file system is able to carry all files within DataverseOS over different applications by linking data streams on ceramic.
Everytime a data stream is created, DataverseOS will automatically create a corresponding file stream,
bind the data stream to it and save to the file system. Every byte of data is part of a file in DataverseOS.
Users can manage their data via the file system.

On top of the file stream, DataverseOS fulfills programmability like `access control` by
integrating with [Lit Protocol](https://litprotocol.com/), allowing applications to build features like
`permission management` and `data sharing` flexibly.
