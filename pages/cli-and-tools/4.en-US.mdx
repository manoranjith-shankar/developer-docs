# Step 4: Register your app to dapp table

Before running your app, you need to fill in your private key in `.env` file.
The private key will be used to sign messages and manage your app as your authorization.
You should keep the key safe as if it is leaked, your app may be stolen.
if you are using self-hosted ceramic node, you should use the private key of the adminDID of your ceramic node.
if you are using test ceramic node, you can use any private key here. We highly recommend you to use
a new private key for testing. You can generate a new private key by running

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hypotyposis/pk-tools
cd pk-tools && npm install && node generate_eth_accounts.js
```

or use docker:

```sh
docker run hypotyposis/pk-tools
```

1. Install dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. deploy your app

```sh
pnpm create-dataverse-app
```

This command will deploy your app to dataverseos testnet and register your app to dapp table.
If successfully, you will see the following output:

```sh
Create successfully, now you can run 'pnpm dev' to run react demo.
```

And the details of your app deployment will be printed out to `/output/app.json`.
An example here:

```json
{
  "createDapp": {
    "id": "0a008b3b-2c05-4d1b-bec4-646c787a9fce",
    "streamIDs": [
      {
        "name": "zooey001_indexFolders",
        "stream_id": "kjzl6hvfrbw6c75ohahxc0qmw1v55zskmxwbd8qa5in63tzo3efuaqn05wmdazv",
        "isPublicDomain": false,
        "encryptable": null
      },
      ...
    ],
    "website": "http://localhost:3000",
    "name": "zooey001",
    "slug": "zooey001",
    "logo": "https://venerable-queijadas-290c8d.netlify.app/logo.png",
    "description": "A simple social media app",
    "defaultFolderName": "Untitled",
    "ceramic": "https://local1.dataverseceramicdaemon.com"
  }
}
```

Once the models are deployed, you will get the `stream_id` of each model. You can use the `stream_id` as the identifier of the models and
use them in your app later.

For more information like the schema of each model, you can visit [graphql panel](https://gateway.beta.dataverse.art/v1/dapp-table/graphql/sandbox)
and use the `getDapp` query to get the details of your app.
