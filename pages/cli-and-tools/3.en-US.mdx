# Step 3: Customize data models

A data model is a conceptual representation of the data structure that will be used under your app.
For example, if you are building a blog app, you might have a `blog` model that represents a blog article.
If you are building a social network, you might have a `profile` model that represents a user profile.
Data models should be defined in a GraphQL schema file. For example, we define a post model in `post.graphql`:

```graphql
type post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount # DID of the user who created this post
  version: CommitID! @documentVersion
  appVersion: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
  text: String @string(maxLength: 300000000) # text content of the post
  images: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000) # images of the post
  videos: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000) # videos of the post
  options: String @string(maxLength: 300000000)
  createdAt: DateTime! # time when the post is created
  updatedAt: DateTime! # time when the post is updated
}
```

This represents a post of a web3 social app. A post may contain text, images, and video content.

The `@createModel` directive is used to tell dataverseos to create a data model for this type.
The `@documentAccount` directive is used to tell dataverseos to create a DID for this type.
The `@documentVersion` directive is used to tell dataverseos to create a version for this type.

`profile` and `post` are here to demonstrate how to define a data model.
You can define your own data models under `models` folder.

For example, if you want to add `comments` to the `post`, you can modify the `post.graphql` like this:

```graphql
type post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount
  version: CommitID! @documentVersion
  appVersion: String! @string(maxLength: 100)
  text: String @string(maxLength: 300000000)
  images: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000)
  videos: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000)
  options: String @string(maxLength: 300000000)
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  comments: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000)
}
```

Here is another example for a `blog` model:

```graphql
type blog @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "post") {
  author: DID! @documentAccount
  version: CommitID! @documentVersion
  title: String @string(maxLength: 100)
  content: String @string(maxLength: 300000000)
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

`author` and `version` are required fields for all data models.`author` is the DID of the user who created the data.
`version` is used to maintain the update history of the data. These 2 fields will be used by DataverseOS. You should NOT modify them and do NOT
need to set them manually when create a stream.

Data models define the important data types in an application. You can use the data models to create data streams and access the data resources.
Creating a data stream under the corresponding model means creating a structured data in the application. For example, creating a data stream using the [`createStream`](/sdk/apis/primitives/createStream) method under the `post` model means publishing a tweet on a social network.

  Models under `fs` folder are special models. They are used by DataverseOS to
  fulfill the encrypted file system. You should NOT modify or delete them.
