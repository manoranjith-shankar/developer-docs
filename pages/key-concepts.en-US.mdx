# Key Concepts

This section explains several key concepts of DataverseOS.

## Sign-in-with-ethereum (SIWE)

`Sign-In with Ethereum` is a feature that allows users to authenticate and access various off-chain services using their blockchain wallet addresses.
Similar to other popular social login options like "Sign-In with Google" or "Sign-In with Facebook," "Sign-In with Ethereum" leverages the blockchain network for authentication purposes.

By utilizing this authentication method, DataverseOS provides a secure, user-centric method for identity and data access authorization.

## Resource

OS defines several kinds of resources that can be considered as composable modules in a personal computer.
These resources serve different system functions, such as **storage**, **computation**, and more.
Developers can request access to these resources from users.

### Ceramic Database

The OS is storing data on Ceramic ComposeDB - a decentralized graph database built on ceramic network.
And we are using SIWE to authenticate users and authorize their access to data resources.
A SIWE message may look like this:

<div className="flex">
  <img
    src="/images/key-concepts/siwe1.png"
    width="40%"
    className="mx-auto my-2.5"
  />

  <img
    src="/images/key-concepts/siwe2.png"
    width="40%"
    className="mx-auto my-2.5"
  />
</div>

The `Resources` in this message content specifies the tables in ceramic database that you are giving access to.
Each `ceramic://model` refers to a table.

## Data model

```graphql
type post @createModel(accountRelation: LIST, description: "post") {
  text: String @string(maxLength: 300000000)
  images: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000)
  videos: [String] @list(maxLength: 10000000) @string(maxLength: 2000000)
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
}
```

A data model is a GraphQL schema that defines a database table structure. For example, the above schema defines a `post` table with the following columns:

`post` table:
| column_name | data_type | is_nullable |
| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| text | String | YES |
| images | Array\<String\> | YES |
| videos | Array\<String\> | YES |
| createdAt | DataTime | NO |
| updatedAt | DateTime | NO |

### Data stream

You can create data streams under a data model. It is like creating records in a database table.
Each data stream has a unique `streamId` and you can load, update, encrypt, and delete the data stream using the streamId and APIs [here](/sdk/apis/primitives).
What is different from a traditional database table is that each record belongs to the specific DID who creates it. For example, if you create a data stream under the `post` model:

```json
{
  "text": "hello",
  "images": ["https://bafk..."],
  "videos": [],
  "createdAt": "2023-06-27T09:59:20.915Z",
  "updatedAt": "2023-06-27T09:59:20.915Z"
}
```

After creating the data stream, the `post` table will have the following record:

<img
  src="/images/key-concepts/table.png"
  width="96%"
  className="mx-auto my-2.5"
/>

and **only your DID** can write to this record.

## Dapp table

<img
  src="/images/key-concepts/dapp-table-overview.png"
  width="96%"
  className="mx-auto my-2.5"
/>

Dapp table is a application registry table to record which data models belong to a specific dApp. For example,
if you have a dApp `dTwitter` and create data model `post` and `comment` for it, these 2 models belong to `dTwitter`.
Only `dTwitter` can create data streams under these 2 models. Dapp table is a table to record this relationship and prevent other dApps(maybe bad) from
accessing data resources of `dTwitter`.

- **private key**: developer's private key to administrate a dApp and (if the dApp is in production) the self-hosted ceramic node.
- **dApp**: an application on DataverseOS.
- **data model**: a GraphQL schema that defines a database table structure.
- **schema**: one model could have multiple version of schemas. Each schema has a unique commitId.
