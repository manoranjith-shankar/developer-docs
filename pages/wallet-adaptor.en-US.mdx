# Wallet Adaptor

In the context of decentralized applications, a wallet adaptor allows you to connect your dApp
with various wallet providers, enabling secure interactions with blockchain networks.
In this section, we'll focus on integrating Dataverse Wallet as a wallet provider using wagmi.

## wagmi

[wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) is a JavaScript library that simplifies interactions with Ethereum wallets and providers.
It offers React hooks and components for easy integration with your dApp.
