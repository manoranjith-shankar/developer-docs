## How are we different from existing operating systems?

- **Identity sovereignty** - The whole system is fully controlled by user DID. All data within
the os is portable with user identity.
- **Encryption and private data** - Ability to store private and encrypted data without 
the hassle of managing private key of the file. Only with user authorization can others access 
personal data while user themselves have the power to decide who can access.
- **Bulit-in data monetization** - Provide users with native one-click data tokenization. Empower users
to earn from their data assets and incubate the data trading ecosystem.
- **Empower super apps** - Provide developers with a programmable data layer with isolation at application-level
and interoperability through data sharing. Developers can build super apps with ease.
- **Decentralized Storage** - Save files on a decentralized data network and ensure the privacy 
and security. Deliver a crypto personal data space on the cloud that is fully controlled by user identity 


## The OS composition

- **Data Wallet** - A portal for users to web3 dapps. Keep data assets safe.
- **Identity Computer** - A cloud-based personal computer fully controlled by user identity.
- **Ecosystem dapps** - A collection of dapps built on top of DataverseOS.
