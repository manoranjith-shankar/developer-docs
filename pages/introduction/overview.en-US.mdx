# What is DataverseOS?

## Overview

DataverseOS is the next generation personal computer on which runs your digital life. It empowers developers to build data apps with ease.
And all these applications will be centered with your digital identity.

It is an **Internet Operating System** that is built on top of the decentralized web stack.
We build DataverseOS to reform a new paradigm of the internet that is fully owned&controlled by user identity.

We have consistently emphasized the significance to truly return data ownership to users.
And we believe that merely _acknowledging_ this ownership is not enough; we need to provide rich and user-friendly operability and allow users to profit from their personal data.
Therefore, we build DataverseOS as a portal to web3 for everyone, which not only stores data but also incentivizes the production of data, maximizes the full potential of data and powers the data economy.

## Advantages

### Identity sovereignty

The whole system is fully controlled by your DID. With various data dApps running on the OS,
all data generated through interactions with the applications will flow to your encrypted data space,
which can only be accessed and operated by your identity.
As data is the most valuable asset on the internet, it will be portable with your identity,
allowing you to travel with your personal data across various dataverse-powered dApps.

### Decentralized storage

The OS utilizes Ceramic - an off-chain decentralized data network built on top of IPFS.
Your files will be saved in a decentralized way, unstoppable, interoperable and easy to access.
Instead of on-chain storage, we choose the right stack to use for delivering a crypto personal data space on the cloud with a rapid&smooth user experience and no transaction fees.

### Data privacy

The OS fulfills Encryption&Decryption process on the client-side, which means that all data will be encrypted before being sent to data network.
With the power of Lit Protocol - a distributed key management network, the OS ensures access to data is granted only to owner of the data or with owner's authorization (for example, an NFT certificate).

### Bulit-in data monetization

The OS provides users with native one-click data tokenization. This allows users to share&sell their data to others or a 3-rd party.
The OS uses NFTs as certificates for data access,
promoting a flexibly programmable and easily tradable paradigm of data sharing.
This will facilitate efficient utilization of data value and foster the prosperity of the data exchange ecosystem.

### Empower super apps

All applications built on top of DataverseOS conform to the same set of standards set by the system.
The OS creates an ever-evolving, mutually beneficial and interoperable ecosystem of applications.
Developers can build their applications with no backend or database required, and users can access all applications with one single identity.

## The OS composition

DataverseOS is composed of 3 high-level components, which are:

- **Identity Computer** - An Internet Personal Computer centered with user identity. It comes with an online desktop, a encrypted file system, and a set of tools for managing user data.
- **Data Wallet** - A portal for users to web3.0 internet. A fully-featured crypto wallet with additional functionalities for protecting user signatures and data resources.
- **DApp Store** - A secure, open, and innovative platform to discover and experience the latest decentralized applications.
