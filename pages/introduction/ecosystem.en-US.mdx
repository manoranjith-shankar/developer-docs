# DApp store

## Data desktop

Identity computer comes with an online desktop.
It is a cloud-based data window that can be opened in a web browser.
Users can sign into this desktop with their own DID to view and manage their data and activities.
They can browse various applications and open them directly within this desktop,
with the applications automatically inheriting the user's identity from the system.

We have built this desktop to enable users to explore the web3 network in one place.

DataverseOS empowers various dapps to provide users with a seamless & rich web3.0 experience.

We have been expanding first-party applications to provide users with essential system functionalities.
For instance, [Finder](https://dataverse-os.com/finder) is our official application, which serves as an encrypted cloud-based personal folder,
enabling users to view, manage, and monetize their cross-application data.

We also provide developers with SDKs and other tools to assist them in developing various applications on the OS,
empowering data privacy and user sovereignty.

A worldwide developer community is building dapps on DataverseOS. The OS aggregates these high-quality applications
in one place providing a seamless quick experience for users.
These applications span across various domains, including decentralized social networking, creator tools, personalized user profiles, news and information, and more.

There has already been a bunch of applications in the dapp store, including:
