# DApp store

DataverseOS empowers various dapps to provide users with a seamless & rich web3.0 experience.

We have been expanding first-party applications to provide users with essential system functionalities.
For instance, [Finder](https://dataverse-os.com/finder) is our official application, which serves as an encrypted cloud-based personal folder,
enabling users to view, manage, and monetize their cross-application data.

We also provide developers with SDKs and other tools to assist them in developing various applications on the OS,
empowering data privacy and user sovereignty.

A worldwide developer community is building dapps on DataverseOS. The OS aggregates these high-quality applications
in one place providing a seamless quick experience for users.
These applications span across various domains, including decentralized social networking, creator tools, personalized user profiles, news and information, and more.

There has already been a bunch of applications in the dapp store, including:
