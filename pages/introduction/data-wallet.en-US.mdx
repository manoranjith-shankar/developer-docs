# Data Wallet

A gateway to explore Web3 internet

Data Wallet is a place to safely store user identity and data resources.

## Safely manage resources
DataverseOS and the latest data networks are all built with EIP-4361 (Sign-in-with-Ethereum) standard. 
`Sign-in-with-Ethereum` defines how users can create identities, authenticate with applications, 
and manage data resources. However, the current implementations of `Sign-in-with-Ethereum` entirely 
rely on a specific format of user signatures. We build Data Wallet to provide a safe and easy way for
users to manage their identities and signatures. Meanwhile, Data Wallet also prevents malicious websites
from stealing user signatures.

Like you need a wallet address to send transactions on blockchain, and therefore there are crypto wallets such
as MetaMask to help manage private keys safely.
You need a specific DID and Sign-in-with-Ethereum signature to interact with DataverseOS and other data networks.
Therefore we build Data Wallet to help manage DID and Sign-in-with-Ethereum signature safely.

## Provide system calls
Data Wallet also provides system calls for developers to interact with DataverseOS.
Developers can use Data Wallet to connect with user identities, request user signatures,
and build personalized services on top of user's data space.
- identityOps
- streamOps
- ACLOps
- FileOps
- other system calls
