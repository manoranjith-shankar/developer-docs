# Data Wallet

A gateway to explore Web3 internet

Data Wallet is a fully-featured crypto wallet with additional functionalities for protecting user signatures and data resources.

## Wallets-in-Wallet

`#WalletsInWallet` is a brand new architecture evolved from our data wallet. It reforges our data wallet into an
aggregator/controller for all normal crypto wallets(like MetaMask, Coinbase). As an application developer, you can
connect with Data Wallet to access the functionalities of [EIP-1193](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) standard,
such as send a transaction on blockchain or call a function of a smart contract. What's more,
you can also access our data management features built on top of ceramic network, lit protocol and other stacks.

## Safely manage resources

DataverseOS and the latest data networks are all built with EIP-4361 (Sign-in-with-Ethereum) standard.
`Sign-in-with-Ethereum` defines how users can create identities, authenticate with applications,
and manage data resources. However, the current implementations of `Sign-in-with-Ethereum` entirely
rely on a specific format of user signatures. We build Data Wallet to provide a safe and easy way for
users to manage their identities and signatures. Meanwhile, Data Wallet also prevents malicious websites
from stealing user signatures.

Like you need a wallet address to send transactions on blockchain, and therefore there are crypto wallets such
as MetaMask to help manage private keys safely.
You need a specific DID and Sign-in-with-Ethereum signature to interact with DataverseOS and other data networks.
Therefore we build Data Wallet to help manage DID and Sign-in-with-Ethereum signature safely.

## Why Data Wallet is needed?

We, along with many data teams nowadays, are using [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)
signatures to enable offline authorization by users for data resources.
In this scenario, the security of the signature is equivalent to the security of the data.
In other words, if a malicious website successfully steals a user's signature,
it can lead to the leakage and tampering of personal data.

We create data wallet in purpose to shape a standard for maintaining signature security in a decentralized manner.
We are committed to bringing this security layer to all traditional crypto wallets, making data security a necessary part of wallet services.
