# Dataverse Wallet

Dataverse Wallet is a web3 crypto wallet that manages both your finances and personal data.

It is a fully-featured cryptocurrency wallet with additional functionality. Beyond sending transactions, NFTs, interacting with DeFi, etc. you can also create, visualize, and manage your DATA in a decentralized manner.

The wallet acts as a gateway to decentralized data applications (dApps). It prevents malicious applications from stealing your personal data without your consent.

The wallet is designed to protect user signatures and resources authenticated via Sign-in with Ethereum (SIWE).

## Compatible with other wallets

Dataverse Wallet introduces a new `WalletsInWallet` architecture for cryptocurrency wallets. This enables users to plug in and connect with DataverseOS using any wallet they already have installed.
It eases the evolution of crypto wallets from just token management to managing both money and personal data.

Dataverse Wallet works as an aggregator for normal cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase, etc. It provides a complete portfolio view and allows you to trade across all assets and connect to any decentralized application with one wallet.

Meanwhile, Dataverse Wallet brings new data functionality to all existing wallets. By plugging into Dataverse Wallet, your current wallet gains abilities like decentralized data storage, data monetization, data unions, and more.

The `WalletsInWallet` architecture creates a seamless experience for users. They can continue using their preferred wallet while unlocking the full potential of web3 data management offered by DataverseOS.

We will also further optimise the ease of use and functionality of the wallet by integrating Account Abstraction in the future.

## Secure resources

DataverseOS and the latest data networks are all built with EIP-4361 (Sign-in-with-Ethereum) standard.
`Sign-in-with-Ethereum` defines how users can create identities, authenticate with applications,
and manage data resources. However, the current implementations of `Sign-in-with-Ethereum` entirely
rely on a specific format of user signatures. We build Data Wallet to provide a safe and easy way for
users to manage their identities and signatures. Meanwhile, Data Wallet also prevents malicious websites
from stealing user signatures.

Like you need a wallet address to send transactions on the blockchain, and therefore there are crypto wallets such
as MetaMask to help manage private keys safely.
You need a specific DID and Sign-in-with-Ethereum signature to interact with DataverseOS and other data networks.
Therefore we build Data Wallet to help manage DID and Sign-in-with-Ethereum signature safely.

## DApp authenticator

## Why Data Wallet is needed?

We, along with many data teams nowadays, are using [EIP-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361)
signatures to enable offline authorization by users for data resources.
In this scenario, the security of the signature is equivalent to the security of the data.
In other words, if a malicious website successfully steals a user's signature,
it can lead to the leakage and tampering of personal data.

We create data wallet in purpose to shape a standard for maintaining signature security in a decentralized manner.
We are committed to bringing this security layer to all traditional crypto wallets, making data security a necessary part of wallet services.
