# Identity Computer

Next-generation pc fully controlled by user identity, built for data dApps.

## Data desktop

Identity computer comes with an online desktop.
It is a cloud-based data window that can be opened in a web browser.
Users can sign into this desktop with their own DID to view and manage their data and activities.
They can browse various applications and open them directly within this desktop,
with the applications automatically inheriting the user's identity from the system.

We have built this desktop to enable users to explore the web3 network in one place.

## Encrypted file system

A decentralized file system that is encrypted and only accessible by users themselves.
We believe that the user should be in control of their data and not the other way around. All data generated during
user interactions with os-powered dApps will be stored in this file system.
It's a file system to visualize and manage all your data over different applications.

**_Everything is a file._** Your creations, interests, contribution, social interactions, and more. All of these
will automactically be saved in this file system. With this private data space, we want to help everyone
gain back control of internet.

## Provide system calls

The identity computer runs an underlying kernel and exposes system calls for developers to
interact with the kernel. System calls can be categorized into the following types:

- identityOps
- streamOps
- ACLOps
- FileOps
- other system calls

## Why are we building identity computer?

If we look back at the history of **DATA**, we can divide it into three stages:

### Stage 1: The invention of personal computer

During this time, we interacted with software on our personal computers,
and the data generated was stored on our hard disks. At that stage,
we had actual control over our own data(no one else can steal data from our hard drive).
However, the challenge was that it wasn't easy for others to access it.
There was no effective means for sharing and facilitating data flow.

### Stage 2: The emergence of the Internet

Subsequently, the advent of the internet completely transformed the landscape.
Suddenly, data had the ability to flow seamlessly between various devices,
granting us access to a plethora of captivating online resources.
However, this marked the beginning of a shift where we gradually relinquished control over our own data due to the centralized nature of today's internet infrastructure.
Presently, computing and storage predominantly occur in a centralized manner.
Consequently, in this stage, we have willingly exchanged our data sovereignty for the unparalleled convenience offered by the internet.

### Stage 3: The rise of Web3 era

Now, let's turn our attention to web3, the internet where data is computed and stored in a decentralized manner.
The forthcoming generation of personal computers aims to combine the convenience of cloud computing with the security and privacy of a local PC.

In summary, we designed identity computer the next generation of PC
â€“ decentralized, cloud-based, and self-controlled.
Essentially, our system is designed by replacing traditional PC hardware components such as the CPU,
memory, and hard disk with decentralized infrastructures, including blockchains,
decentralized storage and databases.
This change empower us to restore complete control over data to the users.
