# Identity Computer

Next-generation pc fully controlled by user identity.

## Encrypted file system
A decentralized file system that is encrypted and only accessible by the user or with the user's permission.
We believe that the user should be in control of their data and not the other way around. All data within
DataverseOS will be saved in this one safe place. It's a file system to visualize and manage all your data
over different applications.

***Everything is a file.*** Your creations, interests, contribution, social interactions, and more. All of these
will automactically be saved in this file system. With this private data space, we want to help everyone
gain back control of internet.
## Dapp launchpad
A decentralized application launchpad that is fully controlled by the user. The user can choose which
applications they want to use and which ones they don't. The user can also choose which applications
to stay in their dashboard. All apps can be launched in the OS directly in a OS-powered mode for smooth
UX.
