## Production of data

Applications are the source of data.

Every day, people generate large amounts of data through their online activities. This data falls into two main categories:

- Content - Includes anything users actively create and share, such as social media posts, photos, videos, and documents.

- Activity Logs - Includes records of users' interactions and behaviors within applications, such as search queries, clicks, views, purchases, and more.

Both types of data originate from people utilizing various online services and applications. The internet is not just a massive file storage system. Rather, it primarily provides access to diverse apps and services that facilitate different aspects of digital life.

These applications effectively serve as interfaces to collect and structure users' data. So most personal data on the internet is generated as a byproduct of users interacting with apps, as opposed to being manually uploaded.

DataverseOS empowers various dapps to provide users with a seamless & rich web3.0 experience.

## Ecosystem apps

We have been expanding first-party applications to provide users with essential system functionalities.
For instance, [Playground](https://dataverse-os.com/playground) is our official social application as a demonstration of decentralized prototype of Twitter,
enabling users to view, manage, and monetize their cross-application data.

We also provide developers with SDKs and other tools to assist them in developing various applications on the OS,
empowering data privacy and user sovereignty.

A worldwide developer community is building dapps on DataverseOS. The OS aggregates these high-quality applications
in one place providing a seamless quick experience for users.
These applications span across various domains, including decentralized social networking, creator tools, personalized user profiles, news and information, and more.

There has already been a bunch of applications in the dapp store, including:

<Cards
  num={3}
  children={apps.map((app, i) => (
    <Card
      key={i}
      title={app.name}
      description={app.description}
      img={app.image}
      href={app.link}
    />
  ))}
/>

<div className="h-5"></div>
